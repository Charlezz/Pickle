Designed based on Paging3.
## Installation

### 1. Add dependency

 Add this line to `build.gradle` for your application module

```bash
dependencies{
    implementation 'com.charlezz:pickle:latest_version'
}
```
### 2. Enable databinding

 Add this line to `build.gradle` for your application module

```
android{
    buildFeatures.dataBinding = true
}
```

For the reason why Pickle uses dataBinding library, you may want to set dataBinding in your app `build.gradle` otherwise you will see the error below.

`java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Landroidx/databinding/DataBinderMapperImpl;`

## How to use

### 1. Initilization

The launcher MUST be initialized before Lifecycle.State.STARTED

```bash
val launcher:ActivityResultLauncher<Config> = getPickle { mediaList:List<Media> ->
    // handle the result
}
```
### 2. Configure your Config if you want and call launch() function

```bash
launcher.launch(Config.default)
```

## Configuration

Customize a config if you want

```
val config = Config.default.apply {  
    //add whatever you want below
    debugMode = false // this flag disables printing log from Timber
}
```

You may want to use SingleConfig when user can pick only one Image or Video.

```
// init
private val singleLauncher = getPickleForSingle { media: Media? ->
    // do something with a media
}
...
// Launch Pickle with SingleConfig
singleLauncher.launch(SingleConfig.default)
```
